                  <p class="separator">A group of researchers has unveiled a new venture that will use`AI to search for alien
technology.
The Galileo Project will use a network of telescopes and astronomical surveys to hunt for
evidence of “extraterrestrial technological civilizations” (ETCs).
AI will play a key role in the program. The team plans to develop algorithms that scan data
from telescopes for alien artifacts. The group will also use existing and future astronomical
surveys “to discover and monitor the properties of interstellar visitors to the solar system.”
The project is spearheaded by Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who raised eyebrows for
suggesting that an object that passed through our solar system could be alien tech. Science

should not reject potential extraterrestrial explanations because of social stigma or cultural
preferences that are not conducive to the scientific method of unbiased, empirical inquiry We
now must ‘dare to look through new telescopes,’ both literally and figuratively.

                  <p class="separator">Enter a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools that could help conservationists expand their
work and bring species back from the brink. Mathematical optimization can help in decision-making
processes by selecting the best option from a set of alternatives, which is especially crucial in solving
complex problems with limited resources, as is the case with nature conservation.
Traditionally, most conservation decisions are made using maps or rules of thumb versus being able to
find alternative plans that consider different budget levels or conservation priorities in a systematic way.
Optimization allows you to find, globally, the best use of the money in a limited budget. A computational
model allows you to say, for instance, in designing the optimal design strategy for nature reserves,
“What if I had $500,000 more?” and generate alternative plans that take into account this extra budget.
The results of these computational models can be used for resource allocation as well as for policy
recommendations.x

                  <p class="separator">Artificial Intelligence(AI) is a wide-ranging tool that allows people to improve the way we collect information, analyze data, and use the resulting insights to improve decision making. Some of the applications of AI include speech recognition, expert systems, and machine vision. AI can be used in casino gaming to improve the overall gaming experience. Also, it is used in the healthcare sector to discover the link between genetic codes, power surgical robots, and so on. Example, In Marvel’s Avengers Endgame, Josh Brolin’s performance was flawlessly rendered into the 9-ft Thanos by a team of animators at Digital Domain. This example was produced using AI and ML tools to automate the part of the process.

                  <p class="separator">Today, building architecture in outer space is not a dream
anymore. Instead, it has become a reality now that is revealing
slowly. Scientists are exploring inhabiting planet Mars and
progressing day by day. Mars may be the perfect hope of a
second home for humans. It is one of the best options accessible
in our solar system. However, the Red Planet is not such inviting.
Mars has some significant elements that make it accommodating.
For example, a thick enough environment shields the architecture

from dangerous solar radiation. Mars gravity is lower than Earth,
giving people a slight benefit. People do not need protecting
radiation for a short visit on Mars, but they will require a thick
protection layer for a permanent stay.Building architecture on
Mars and energy are two complex elements included in
challenges to support human life on Mars.

                  <p class="separator">It is already a time when robots will be drawing and painting. Artwork created
by robots (and robot/human) teams, ranging from immersive murals to
abstract pieces to epic collaborative works, is redefining how we experience art
and technology. A growing number of galleries exhibit exclusively computer-
generated artworks created by robots. Is it the robot, the person who created
the robot, or the algorithms that create the artwork that is the real artist? Can
these robots create their works independently, without human involvement?

Moreover, since much of robot art is created in collaboration with its creator or
trainer, the lines of this debate are further blurred. Trainers or collaborators are
often established artists, like the Sophia/Andrea Bonaceto collaboration. What
portion of this work should be viewed as “original” to the robot’s creative
impulses? Are we really collaborating with robots here, or is it simply human art
created using robotic machines?
Humans do the same thing, channeling their knowledge and training to create
works of art, although some might argue that robots simply channel what’s
coded and uploaded to their systems.

other animal on the planet. There is no doubt that artificial
intelligence will bring astoundingly positive things with it. But at
the same time there are always two sides of a coin. Having said
that, one cannot argue over the fact that there are certain events
in which utilization of a robot can actually turn out to be much
more efficient when compared to a human being. However, it is
imperative to state that it is the human finesse that controls,
operates, and direct the use of such a technology. In every kind

of industry that makes an extensive use of artificial intelligence,
human input, human interaction, and human judgment can still
not be replaced by the capabilities of an artificially intelligent
machine. Also, Robots like Sophia, though has capabilities much
more than a human being but surely it lacks emotions.

                  <p class="separator">The human body is not infallible, but through the wonders of A.I. research
scientists are finding ways to address those imperfections. A.I. has the potential
to heal, enhance and make up for the things our bodies lack. Artificial intelligence
originally aspired to replace doctors. Researchers imagined robots that could
ask you questions, run the answers through an algorithm that would learn
with experience and tell whether you had the flu or a cold. However, those
promises largely failed, as artificial intelligent algorithms were too
rudimentary to perform those functions. Particularly tricky was the variability
between people, which caused basic machine learning algorithms to miss
the patterns. Eventually though, a subset of AI called deep learning became

sensitive enough to recognize speech from voice data. Although deep
learning algorithms required loads of training data, they could eventually
learn to recognize words regardless of accents and other differences in
speech patterns.
After recognizing speech, technologists applied deep learning to recognize
objects in image data — which remains its primary application today. For
instance, driverless cars largely depend on deep learning to identify and
navigate around people to safely get their occupants home.

                  <p class="separator"> The term artificial can be anything that is made by human beings which is not natural. And the term
intelligence is the ability to understand, think, and learn. When we combine these two
together, we get a broad area of computer science that makes machines seem like they have
human intelligence. AI is designed so you do not realize that there is a machine calling
the shots. In the near future, AI is expected to become a little less artificial and a lot
more intelligent. As AI becomes more intelligent, it will obviously take on the role of an
intelligent worker. While most of the repetitive and largely time-oriented tasks can be
automated using AI, we will still need human experts who can build and maintain these
synthetic BOTS and work on strategic and creative aspects of a job. AI is a branch of
computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers. AI is
teaching the machine and the machine becoming smart. Intelligence used to be the
province of only humans, but it no longer is. We don’t program the machines. They
learn by themselves.
